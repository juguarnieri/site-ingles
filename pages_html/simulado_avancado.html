            <h2>ADM&TEC 2024</h2>

            <h3 class="h3-questions">Netflix is trying to prove to the world that it's all grown up</h3>
            <p>Netflix is trying to persuade Wall Street that it is now all grown up. After squeezing out millions of additional subscribers via its password sharing crackdown and through the introduction of cheaper advertiser-supported plans, the streamer knows that its growth spurts are coming to an end — and now it wants investors to stop obsessing over those pesky membership numbers and instead focus on other metrics.

               <p> "In our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential. But now we're generating very substantial profit and free cash flow. We are also developing new revenue streams like advertising and our extra member feature, so memberships are just one component of our growth", Netflix told shareholders as it reported quarterly earnings.</p>
               <p> To that end, Netflix said that it will no longer report quarterly subscriber numbers, starting in 2025. Alas, the metric that Wall Street has forever judged Netflix on — the metric that prompted legacy media companies to burn endless piles of cash in their bids to compete with the streamer — will be retired. The decision to shut off transparency on the metric represents a significant turning point in the streaming revolution. For years, Netflix has prided itself on being extraordinarily transparent. Now it is aiming to hold its cards closer to its chest. And given that streaming giant is the trendsetter in the space, one could expect that other media companies will be inspired by the company's move and also opt to cease reporting such data.</p>
               <p> To be fair, what Netflix is saying isn't necessarily off base either. As the company shifts its business model away from subscriptions and toward advertising and other revenue streams, it makes sense to consider how much time users are spending on the service. The more content a user consumes on Netflix, the more likely they are to continue paying for the service, and the more money Netflix then makes from that single subscriber. "We're focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics — and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction,” Netflix underscored in its letter to shareholders.</p>
               <p> Regardless, less transparency in an already opaque industry is not ideal. The walled garden of streaming already lacks the same detailed viewership data that Nielsen collects on linear television broadcasters. Now, visibility into the streaming world will get even dimmer.</p>
               <p> The announcement from Netflix managed to overshadow its otherwise stellar quarter. The company handily beat expectations and added a staggering 9.3 million subscribers, meaning it now boasts nearly 270 million in total. Netflix also beat analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue. However, it wasn't all good news. Netflix forecasted its subscriber growth to be lower in quarter two, chalking it up to “typical seasonality.” That led the stock to slide nearly 5% in after-hours trading.</p>
               <p> Whether "typical seasonality” is solely to blame, or whether the streamer is simply starting to hit a ceiling, is hard to tell. Perhaps it is a mix of both. Whatever the cause, the stock sliding on the less-than-ideal outlook is a prime example of why Netflix wants Wall Street to stop focusing on its subscriber numbers. And, in one year's time, investors won't have a choice.</p>

                    <p >We' ve been given no shortage of digital tools that should, in theory, help us work better, with more focus and efficiency, and connect us more easily with our colleagues. Instead, email, instant messaging, remote-meeting apps, work-flow and project-management software can feel like buckets with holes in the bottom, maddeningly inadequate to the task of keeping us from drowning in work. It' s clear that something in the great digital-workplace experiment has gone wrong. Or maybe it' s more accurate to say that it' s still too early to expect that we would have figured out how to make things go right. "We' re working now with new technologies that only emerged in the "90s," says Cal Newport, a Georgetown computer-science professor. "The idea that we immediately figured out the best way to use them is ahistorical. Of course we haven' t gotten it right yet."

                    <p>The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing index rose to 53.2 from 51.3 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Separate data showed construction spending rose slightly in January, helped by residential construction.
                        Manufacturing and construction are key to the US economy and there were fears that severe weather across many parts of the US may have hurt the sectors. Bradley Holcomb, chair of ISM’s survey committee, said that while several manufacturers said severe weather was impacting their business, “other comments reflect optimism in terms of demand and growth in the near term”. Meanwhile, data released by the US Department of Commerce, showed that construction spending rose 0.1% in January, from December. Compared to the same month last year, construction spending was up 9.3%.
                        However, the bad weather conditions impacted car sales in February with General Motors, Toyota and Ford all posting declines in their deliveries. But the drop in sales was less than expected and manufacturers were upbeat about the prospects in the coming months. “February auto sales emerged from a chill in the second half of the month, positioning the industry for a strong March,” said Bill Fay, general manager at Toyota, which saw a fall in deliveries of 4% during the month. General Motors’ sales fell 1%, compared to analysts’ forecast of a 6% drop. Chrysler and Nissan Motors beat the trend with sales increases of 11% and 16% respectively.
                        Analysts said that overall car sales during the month had been helped by incentives and discounts offered by dealers to lure customers to showrooms in an attempt to cushion the impact of the severe weather conditions. However, as weather conditions improve, the discounts will reduce.
