                <article class="question-text2">
                    <p> Vincent van Gogh. Salvador Dalí. Frida Kahlo. Casual perusers of ads everywhere would be
                        forgiven for thinking that art galleries are enjoying some sort of golden age. The truth is less
                        exciting, more expensive and certainly more depressing. For this is no ordinary art on offer;
                        this art is “immersive”, the latest lovechild of TikTok and enterprising warehouse landlords.
                        The first problem with immersive art? It's not actually very immersive. A common trope of
                        “immersive” retrospectives is to recreate original pieces using gimmicky tech. But merely aiming
                        a projector at a blank canvas doesn’t do much in the way of sensory stimulation. My favourite
                        element of an “immersive” show I have been to was their faithful recreation of Van Gogh’s
                        bedroom. An ambitious feat, executed with some furniture and, of course, mutilated pastiches of
                        his paintings. While projectors, surround sound and uncomfortably wacky seating are mainstays of
                        immersive art, there are also the VR headsets. But many exhibitions don’t even include these
                        with the standard ticket, so my return to reality has twice been accompanied by an usher
                        brandishing a credit card machine. Sometimes these installations are so banal and depthless,
                        visitors have often walked through installations entirely oblivious to whatever is happening
                        around them. Despite the fixation “immersive experiences” have with novelty, the products of
                        their labours are remarkably similar: disappointing light shows punctuated by a few gamified set
                        pieces.</p>

                <article class="question-text2">
                    <p>Over the last two decades, technology companies and policymakers warned of a “digital divide” in
                        which poor children could fall behind their more affluent peers without equal access to
                        technology. Today, with widespread internet access and smartphone ownership, the gap has
                        narrowed sharply.

                        But with less fanfare a different division has appeared: Across the country, poor children and
                        adolescents are participating far less in sports and fitness activities than more affluent
                        youngsters are. Call it the physical divide. Data from multiple sources reveal a significant gap
                        in sports participation by income level.

                        A combination of factors is responsible. Spending cuts and changing priorities at some public
                        schools have curtailed physical education classes and organized sports. At the same time,
                        privatized youth sports have become a multibilliondollar enterprise offering new opportunities —
                        at least for families that can afford hundreds to thousands of dollars each season for club-team
                        fees, uniforms, equipment, travel to tournaments and private coaching.

                        “What’s happened as sports has become privatized is that it has become the haves and have-nots,”
                        said Jon Solomon, editorial director for the Aspen Institute Sports and Society Program.
                        “Particularly for low-income kids, if they don’t have access to sports within the school
                        setting, where are they going to get their physical activity?” Mr. Solomon said. “The answer is
                        nowhere.”</p>

                    <p><b>The climate is changing — the thing is, it isn’t just due to humans</b> <br>
                        <br>
                        By Tonya T. Neaves <br>
                        <br>
                        Natural forces beyond human control are also gradually affecting our climate. These geophysical
                        forces are vital to understanding global warming. Man is indeed responsible for a large portion
                        — possibly even a majority — of global warming. But also in play are complex gravitational
                        interactions, including changes in the Earth’s orbit, axial tilt and torque. This fact needs to
                        be included in the public debate. Because these gravitational shifts, occurring over millennia,
                        can influence climate patterns and ultimately lead to noticeable variations in seasons. <br>
                        <br>
                        Interestingly, research suggests climate change can alter the tilt of the Earth, but an
                        unrelated change in tilt can also further change the climate. It is a balance-counterbalance
                        relationship. Changes in seasons can also affect other types of storms, including severe winter
                        snowstorms and tornadoes. The variations in the Earth’s orbit are known as the Milankovitch
                        cycles — after the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovic, who hypothesized this phenomenon in
                        the 1920s. He discovered that variations in the Earth’s path around the Sun, axial tilt and
                        torque could together affect our climate. <br>
                        <br>
                        Even a slight change or orientation in the precession of the Earth’s rotating body can cause a
                        wobbling effect shifting torque in different areas since the planet is not a perfect sphere to
                        some people’s surprise. Now would seem a particularly apt time to act. The 2017 Atlantic
                        hurricane season was an intense, record-setting period. With several landfall hurricanes
                        barreling their way through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, devastating parts of the Leeward
                        Islands and United States. <br>
                        <br>
                        Still, even President Donald J. Trump has implied the whole of idea climate change may just be a
                        hoax. Most Republicans seem to agree that it is not a serious problem. Meanwhile, while some
                        Democrats have tried to use the frequency and intensity of storms in the hopes of highlighting
                        the climate change conversation, even this effort has seemed muted. The heightened culture of
                        disaster only feeds our attention on political banter and ideological semantics with no room for
                        informed 20 decision-making. <br>
                        <br>
                        Though climate change is inevitable, we also need to have a healthy appreciation of the fact
                        that climate shifts aren’t just limited to rapidly changing weather patterns. Turning the corner
                        into unexplored territory is always difficult. By having a broader sense of communal resiliency
                        — social, political and economic standing — we can manage this unavoidable pendulum of climate
                        extremes.

                    <p> <b>Climate of conspiracy: A meta-analysis of the consequences of belief in conspiracy theories
                            about climate change</b> <br>
                        <br>
                        By Mikey Biddlestone, Flavio Azevedo, Sander van der Linden <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite widespread scientific consensus on climate change, conspiracy theories about its causes
                        and consequences are flourishing. In response, psychological research has started to investigate
                        the consequences of espousing conspiracy beliefs about climate change. Although some scholars
                        maintain that the evidence for a causal link between belief in conspiracy theories and behavior
                        remains elusive, others have argued that climate change conspiracy theories undermine
                        pro-climate action. Overall, we find clear evidence that climate conspiracy beliefs have
                        moderate-to-large negative correlations with not only acceptance of (climate) science, trust,
                        and pro-environmental concern, but also with behavioural intentions and policy support. <br>
                        <br>
                        Most of these effects were not moderated by design (experimental vs. correlational), political
                        ideology, or prior conspiracy beliefs. After a meta-analysis we find clear evidence that climate
                        change conspiracy beliefs correlate with a host of concerning societal outcomes, including lower
                        acceptance of (climate) science, distrust, lower concern for the environment, and also lower
                        intentions to take action and support pro-environmental policies. An important open question
                        concerns the direction of causality. Although it is possible—and perhaps likely—that people who
                        are skeptical of climate change are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories about global
                        warming, we can also expect that people who are exposed to climate change conspiracy theories
                        become more skeptical and are less likely to take pro-environmental action. <br>
                        <br>
                        In one of the included experiments, people were less likely to sign a petition to counter
                        climate change following exposure to a conspiracy theory about global warming. At the same time,
                        we note that the number of experiments included in the analysis was unbalanced and relatively
                        low compared to the number of correlational designs, which is likely a reflection of the larger
                        literature: most studies do not provide an experimental test of whether exposure to conspiracy
                        theories causes people to disengage from science and politics. Interestingly, our moderation
                        analyses generally did not find that the observed effect sizes were impacted by study design,
                        with the exception of pro-environmental policy-support. Moreover, although publication bias was
                        present in many cases—which is somewhat expected considering our exclusion of the grey
                        literature—the bias-corrected meta-analytic effect sizes were similar to those obtained in the
                        main analyses. <br>
                        <br>
                        Nonetheless, given the fact that only a few experimental studies were available for each outcome
                        variable, we feel that it is premature to make any firm conclusions about the overall absence of
                        moderation effects based on study design. In fact, it is interesting that in the case of policy
                        support, data from the only experimental study did not corrobate the correlational evidence. In
                        all likelihood, both causal pathways are possible and potentially mutually reinforcing so that
                        people with skeptical prior attitudes might seek out conspiracy theories about climate change,
                        whilst those exposed to conspiracy theories also become more skeptical about the issue. <br>
                        <br>
                        Consistent with long standing political polarization on the issue of climate change at both
                        elite and mass publics levels—at least in the United States—a large body of work has supported
                        an asymmetrical relationship, such that the endorsement of climate change conspiracy theories
                        appears stronger on the political right. Although conservative ideology itself had a strong
                        positive meta-analytic correlation with belief in climate conspiracies (r = 0.45), it is
                        interesting to note that the effect sizes were not reliably moderated by political orientation
                        for any of the outcome measures. Similarly, we do not find evidence of reliable moderation
                        effects for prior conspiracy beliefs. In addition, contrary to evidence which suggests that
                        climate denial is uniquely prevalent in the United States, the effect-sizes were not moderated
                        by country in our meta-analysis. <br>
                        <br>
                        However, we note that the overwhelming majority of studies (86%) and participants (96%) were
                        US-based. Although some interventions—such as highlighting scientific consensus and
                        psychological inoculation —have shown promise in combatting conspiracy beliefs, considering that
                        in many countries almost a third of the population endorses the belief that climate change is
                        hoax, future research should urgently evaluate how to counter public belief in climate change
                        conspiracy theories. We note, in many cases, the need to gather more data (from non-WEIRD
                        samples), and the presence of publication bias and effect size heterogeneity..

                    <p> About seven years ago, three researchers at the University of Toronto built a system that could
                        analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to recognize everyday objects, like dogs, cars and
                        flowers. The system was so effective that Google bought the tiny start-up these researchers were
                        only just getting off the ground. And soon, their system sparked a technological revolution.
                        Suddenly, machines could "see" in a way that was not possible in the past.

                        were looking for. It accelerated the progress of driverless cars and other robotics. And it
                        improved the accuracy of facial recognition services, for social networks like Facebook and for
                        the country 's law enforcement agencies. But soon, researchers noticed that these facial
                        recognition services were less accurate when used with women and people of color. Activists
                        raised concerns over how companies were collecting the huge amounts of data needed to train
                        these kinds of systems. Others worried these systems would eventually lead to mass surveillance
                        or autonomous weapons.
