                <article class="question-text2">
                    <p> Vincent van Gogh. Salvador Dalí. Frida Kahlo. Casual perusers of ads everywhere would be
                        forgiven for thinking that art galleries are enjoying some sort of golden age. The truth is less
                        exciting, more expensive and certainly more depressing. For this is no ordinary art on offer;
                        this art is “immersive”, the latest lovechild of TikTok and enterprising warehouse landlords.
                        The first problem with immersive art? It's not actually very immersive. A common trope of
                        “immersive” retrospectives is to recreate original pieces using gimmicky tech. But merely aiming
                        a projector at a blank canvas doesn’t do much in the way of sensory stimulation. My favourite
                        element of an “immersive” show I have been to was their faithful recreation of Van Gogh’s
                        bedroom. An ambitious feat, executed with some furniture and, of course, mutilated pastiches of
                        his paintings. While projectors, surround sound and uncomfortably wacky seating are mainstays of
                        immersive art, there are also the VR headsets. But many exhibitions don’t even include these
                        with the standard ticket, so my return to reality has twice been accompanied by an usher
                        brandishing a credit card machine. Sometimes these installations are so banal and depthless,
                        visitors have often walked through installations entirely oblivious to whatever is happening
                        around them. Despite the fixation “immersive experiences” have with novelty, the products of
                        their labours are remarkably similar: disappointing light shows punctuated by a few gamified set
                        pieces.</p>

                <article class="question-text2">
                    <p>Over the last two decades, technology companies and policymakers warned of a “digital divide” in
                        which poor children could fall behind their more affluent peers without equal access to
                        technology. Today, with widespread internet access and smartphone ownership, the gap has
                        narrowed sharply. </p>

                    <p>But with less fanfare a different division has appeared: Across the country, poor children and
                        adolescents are participating far less in sports and fitness activities than more affluent
                        youngsters are. Call it the physical divide. Data from multiple sources reveal a significant gap
                        in sports participation by income level.</p>

                    <p>A combination of factors is responsible. Spending cuts and changing priorities at some public
                        schools have curtailed physical education classes and organized sports. At the same time,
                        privatized youth sports have become a multibilliondollar enterprise offering new opportunities —
                        at least for families that can afford hundreds to thousands of dollars each season for club-team
                        fees, uniforms, equipment, travel to tournaments and private coaching.</p>

                    <p>“What’s happened as sports has become privatized is that it has become the haves and have-nots,”
                        said Jon Solomon, editorial director for the Aspen Institute Sports and Society Program.
                        “Particularly for low-income kids, if they don’t have access to sports within the school
                        setting, where are they going to get their physical activity?” Mr. Solomon said. “The answer is
                        nowhere.”</p>

                    <p><b>The climate is changing — the thing is, it isn’t just due to humans</b></p>

                    <p>By Tonya T. Neaves</p>

                    <p>Natural forces beyond human control are also gradually affecting our climate. These geophysical
                        forces are vital to understanding global warming. Man is indeed responsible for a large portion
                        — possibly even a majority — of global warming. But also in play are complex gravitational
                        interactions, including changes in the Earth’s orbit, axial tilt and torque. This fact needs to
                        be included in the public debate. Because these gravitational shifts, occurring over millennia,
                        can influence climate patterns and ultimately lead to noticeable variations in seasons.</p>

                    <p>Interestingly, research suggests climate change can alter the tilt of the Earth, but an
                        unrelated change in tilt can also further change the climate. It is a balance-counterbalance
                        relationship. Changes in seasons can also affect other types of storms, including severe winter
                        snowstorms and tornadoes. The variations in the Earth’s orbit are known as the Milankovitch
                        cycles — after the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovic, who hypothesized this phenomenon in
                        the 1920s. He discovered that variations in the Earth’s path around the Sun, axial tilt and
                        torque could together affect our climate.</p>

                    <p>Even a slight change or orientation in the precession of the Earth’s rotating body can cause a
                        wobbling effect shifting torque in different areas since the planet is not a perfect sphere to
                        some people’s surprise. Now would seem a particularly apt time to act. The 2017 Atlantic
                        hurricane season was an intense, record-setting period. With several landfall hurricanes
                        barreling their way through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, devastating parts of the Leeward
                        Islands and United States.</p>

                    <p>Still, even President Donald J. Trump has implied the whole of idea climate change may just be a
                        hoax. Most Republicans seem to agree that it is not a serious problem. Meanwhile, while some
                        Democrats have tried to use the frequency and intensity of storms in the hopes of highlighting
                        the climate change conversation, even this effort has seemed muted. The heightened culture of
                        disaster only feeds our attention on political banter and ideological semantics with no room for
                        informed 20 decision-making.</p>

                    <p>Though climate change is inevitable, we also need to have a healthy appreciation of the fact
                        that climate shifts aren’t just limited to rapidly changing weather patterns. Turning the corner
                        into unexplored territory is always difficult. By having a broader sense of communal resiliency
                        — social, political and economic standing — we can manage this unavoidable pendulum of climate
                        extremes.</p>

                    <p><b>Climate of conspiracy: A meta-analysis of the consequences of belief in conspiracy theories
                            about climate change</b></p>

                    <p>By Mikey Biddlestone, Flavio Azevedo, Sander van der Linden</p>

                    <p>Despite widespread scientific consensus on climate change, conspiracy theories about its causes
                        and consequences are flourishing. In response, psychological research has started to investigate
                        the consequences of espousing conspiracy beliefs about climate change. Although some scholars
                        maintain that the evidence for a causal link between belief in conspiracy theories and behavior
                        remains elusive, others have argued that climate change conspiracy theories undermine
                        pro-climate action. Overall, we find clear evidence that climate conspiracy beliefs have
                        moderate-to-large negative correlations with not only acceptance of (climate) science, trust,
                        and pro-environmental concern, but also with behavioural intentions and policy support.</p>

                    <p>Most of these effects were not moderated by design (experimental vs. correlational), political
                        ideology, or prior conspiracy beliefs. After a meta-analysis we find clear evidence that climate
                        change conspiracy beliefs correlate with a host of concerning societal outcomes, including lower
                        acceptance of (climate) science, distrust, lower concern for the environment, and also lower
                        intentions to take action and support pro-environmental policies. An important open question
                        concerns the direction of causality. Although it is possible—and perhaps likely—that people who
                        are skeptical of climate change are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories about global
                        warming, we can also expect that people who are exposed to climate change conspiracy theories
                        become more skeptical and are less likely to take pro-environmental action.</p>

                    <p>In one of the included experiments, people were less likely to sign a petition to counter
                        climate change following exposure to a conspiracy theory about global warming. At the same time,
                        we note that the number of experiments included in the analysis was unbalanced and relatively
                        low compared to the number of correlational designs, which is likely a reflection of the larger
                        literature: most studies do not provide an experimental test of whether exposure to conspiracy
                        theories causes people to disengage from science and politics. Interestingly, our moderation
                        analyses generally did not find that the observed effect sizes were impacted by study design,
                        with the exception of pro-environmental policy-support. Moreover, although publication bias was
                        present in many cases—which is somewhat expected considering our exclusion of the grey
                        literature—the bias-corrected meta-analytic effect sizes were similar to those obtained in the
                        main analyses.</p>

                    <p>Nonetheless, given the fact that only a few experimental studies were available for each outcome
                        variable, we feel that it is premature to make any firm conclusions about the overall absence of
                        moderation effects based on study design. In fact, it is interesting that in the case of policy
                        support, data from the only experimental study did not corrobate the correlational evidence. In
                        all likelihood, both causal pathways are possible and potentially mutually reinforcing so that
                        people with skeptical prior attitudes might seek out conspiracy theories about climate change,
                        whilst those exposed to conspiracy theories also become more skeptical about the issue.</p>

                    <p>Consistent with long standing political polarization on the issue of climate change at both
                        elite and mass publics levels—at least in the United States—a large body of work has supported
                        an asymmetrical relationship, such that the endorsement of climate change conspiracy theories
                        appears stronger on the political right. Although conservative ideology itself had a strong
                        positive meta-analytic correlation with belief in climate conspiracies (r = 0.45), it is
                        interesting to note that the effect sizes were not reliably moderated by political orientation
                        for any of the outcome measures. Similarly, we do not find evidence of reliable moderation
                        effects for prior conspiracy beliefs. In addition, contrary to evidence which suggests that
                        climate denial is uniquely prevalent in the United States, the effect-sizes were not moderated
                        by country in our meta-analysis.</p>

                    <p>However, we note that the overwhelming majority of studies (86%) and participants (96%) were
                        US-based. Although some interventions—such as highlighting scientific consensus and
                        psychological inoculation —have shown promise in combatting conspiracy beliefs, considering that
                        in many countries almost a third of the population endorses the belief that climate change is
                        hoax, future research should urgently evaluate how to counter public belief in climate change
                        conspiracy theories. We note, in many cases, the need to gather more data (from non-WEIRD
                        samples), and the presence of publication bias and effect size heterogeneity..</p>

                    <p> About seven years ago, three researchers at the University of Toronto built a system that could
                        analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to recognize everyday objects, like dogs, cars and
                        flowers. The system was so effective that Google bought the tiny start-up these researchers were
                        only just getting off the ground. And soon, their system sparked a technological revolution.
                        Suddenly, machines could "see" in a way that was not possible in the past.</p>

                    <p>This made it easier for a smartphone app to search your personal photos and find the images you
                        were looking for. It accelerated the progress of driverless cars and other robotics. And it
                        improved the accuracy of facial recognition services, for social networks like Facebook and for
                        the country 's law enforcement agencies. But soon, researchers noticed that these facial
                        recognition services were less accurate when used with women and people of color. Activists
                        raised concerns over how companies were collecting the huge amounts of data needed to train
                        these kinds of systems. Others worried these systems would eventually lead to mass surveillance

                    <p> <b>Read Your Way Through Salvador</b> </p>

                    <p>By Itamar Vieira Junior and translated by Johnny Lorenz. July 19, 2023.</p>

                    <p>I was born in Salvador, in the Brazilian state of Bahia, and lived in the general vicinity until
                        I reached the age of 15. But it was when I left that I really came to know my city. How was I
                        able to discover more about my birthplace while traveling far from home? It might sound rather
                        clichéd but, I assure you, literature made this possible: It took me on a journey, long and
                        profound, back home, enveloping me in words and imagination.</p>

                    <p>To understand the formation of our unique society and, consequently, the cityscape of Salvador,
                        one should read, before anything else, “The Story of Rufino: Slavery, Freedom and Islam in the
                        Black Atlantic,” by João José Reis, Flávio dos Santos Gomes and Marcus J.M. de Carvalho. Rufino
                        was an alufá, or Muslim spiritual leader, born in the Oyo empire in present-day Nigeria and
                        enslaved during his adolescence. “The Story of Rufino” is an epic tale, encapsulating the life
                        of one man in search of freedom as well as the history of the development of Salvador itself, a
                        place inextricably linked with the diaspora across the Black Atlantic. Another book for which I
                        have deep affection is “The City of Women,” by the American anthropologist Ruth Landes. It
                        offers an intriguing perspective, focusing on matriarchal power in candomblé, an Afro-Brazilian
                        sacred practice, and revealing how the social organization of its spiritual communities
                        reverberates across the city.</p>

                    <p>If you want to feel the intensity of life on the streets of Salvador, these two books, both by
                        Amado, are indispensable: “Captains of the Sands” and “Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands.” The
                        first is a coming-of-age story in which we follow a group of children and adolescents living on
                        the streets and on the beaches around the Bay of All Saints. Written more than 80 years ago, the
                        book was banned and even burned in the public square during the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas
                        in the first half of the 20th century. As a portrait of Salvador, it is still relevant and
                        reveals our deep inequalities. “Dona Flor and her Two Husbands” is one of Amado’s most popular
                        novels, translated into more than 30 languages and adapted many times for theater, cinema, and
                        television. The book is a kind of manifesto for a woman’s liberation. Dona Flor possesses great
                        culinary talent, and oppressed by a patriarchal society, finds herself divided between two men,
                        one being her deceased husband. While the novel captures the daily life of the city in the
                        1940s, it is also a wonderful guide to the cuisine of Salvador, with its African and Portuguese
                        influences.</p>

                    <p>I invite readers to travel into the interior of Bahia, many hours by car from Salvador to the
                        region known as the Sertão, whose name translates loosely to “backwoods.” Two books can also
                        transport you there, and they are sides of the same story: “Backlands: The Canudos Campaign,” by
                        Euclides da Cunha, and “The War of the End of the World,” by Mario Vargas Llosa.</p>

                    <p>“Backlands” is one of the most important works in the history of Brazilian literature. It is a
                        journalistic telling that introduces us not only to the brutal War of Canudos, but also to the
                        intriguing landscape of the Sertão, a place so full of contradictions. In his writing of the
                        conflict, da Cunha tells the story of the genesis of the tough sertanejo: a mythic, cowboyesque
                        figure of the drought-stricken, lawless interior. “The War of the End of the World” is an
                        essential epic that amplifies the narrative of “Backlands,” bringing a more 11 imaginative,
                        creative aspect to the story of Antônio Conselheiro, the spiritual leader of a rebellion, and of
                        the multitude that followed him to their deaths.</p>

                    <p><b>The surprising history of India’s vibrant sari tradition</b></p>

                    <p>South Asian women have draped themselves in colorful silks and cottons for eons. The ways
                        they’re made and worn are dazzling and diverse.</p>

                    <p>The word “sari” means “strip of cloth” in Sanskrit. But for the Indian women – and a few men –
                        who have been wrapping themselves in silk, cotton, or linen for millennia, these swaths of
                        fabric are more than just simple garments. They’re symbols of national pride, ambassadors for
                        traditional (and cutting-edge) design and craftsmanship, and a prime example of the rich
                        differences in India’s 29 states.</p>

                    <p>“The sari both as symbol and reality has filled the imagination of the subcontinent, with its
                        appeal and its ability to conceal and reveal the personality of the person wearing it,” says
                        Delhi-based textile historian Rta Kapur Chishti, author of Saris of India: Tradition and Beyond
                        and co-founder of Taanbaan, a fabric company devoted to reviving and preserving traditional
                        Indian spinning and weaving methods.</p>

                    <p>The first mention of saris (alternately spelled sarees) is in the Rig Veda, a Hindu book of
                        hymns dating to 3,000 B.C.; draped garments show up on Indian sculptures from the first through
                        sixth centuries, too. What Delhi-based textile historian Rta Kapur Chishti calls the “magical
                        unstitched garment” is ideally suited to India’s blazingly hot climate and the modest-dress
                        customs of both Hindu and Muslim communities. Saris also remain traditional for women in other
                        South Asian countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.</p>

                    <p><b>Britain bans gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2040</b></p>

                    <p>Britain will ban sales of new gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2040 as part of a bid to
                        clean up the country’s air. The decision to phase out the internal combustion engine heralds a
                        new era of low-emission technologies with major implications for the auto industry, society and
                        the environment. “We can’t carry on with diesel and petrol cars”, U.K. environment secretary
                        Michael Gove told the BBC on Wednesday. “There is no alternative to embracing new technology”.
                        Almost 2.7 million new cars were registered in the U.K. in 2016, making it the second biggest
                        market in Europe after Germany.</p>

                    <p>Meeting the 2040 deadline will be a heavy lift. British demand for electric and fuel cell cars,
                        as well as plug-in hybrids, grew 40% in 2015, but they only accounted for less than 3% of the
                        market. Still, experts say sales of clean cars are likely to continue on their dramatic upward
                        trajectory.</p>

                    <p>The car industry says that demand for electric vehicles will only reach a tipping point once
                        they're cheaper to own than conventional vehicles. The deadline was announced by the government
                        on Wednesday as part of a plan to reduce air
                        pollution. The blueprint highlighted roughly £1.4 billion in government investment designed to
                        help ensure that every vehicle on the road in Britain produces zero emissions by 2050.</p>

                    <p>Gove said action was needed because gasoline and diesel engines contribute to health problems,
                        “accelerate climate change, do damage to the planet and the next generation”. Roughly 40,000
                        deaths in Britain each year are attributable to outdoor air pollution, according to a study
                        published last year by the Royal College of Physicians. Dirty air has been linked to cancer,
                        asthma, stroke and heart disease, among other health issues.</p>

                    <p>The problem is especially pronounced in big cities. London surpassed the European Union’s annual
                        limit for nitrogen dioxide exposure just five days into the new year, according to King’s
                        College. The university estimates that air pollution is responsible for 9,400 premature deaths
                        in the city every year.</p>

                    <p>The timeline for ending sales of internal combustion engines mirrors one proposed in early July
                        by France. President Emmanuel Macron has given the auto industry the same deadline to make the
                        switch to cleaner tech.</p>

                    <p>“We are quite rightly in a position of global leadership when it comes to shaping new
                        technology”, Gove said. But the auto industry, which supports over 800,000 jobs in the U.K., is
                        wary of hard deadlines.</p>

                    <p>Other countries have been even more ambitious than the U.K. India is planning to stop selling
                        gas-powered vehicles by 2030. The German car industry and government officials will meet in
                        early August to discuss the future
                        of diesel engine technology.Manufacturers are trying to avoid diesel cars being banned from
                        German towns and cities.</p>

                    <p>Two in every three people on the planet–some 4 billion in total–are “excluded from the rule of
                        law.” In many cases, this begins with the lack of official recognition of their birth: around
                        40% of the developing world’s five-year old children are not registered as even existing.</p>

                    <p>Later, people will find that the home they live in, the land they farm, or the business that
                        they start, is not protected by legally enforceable property rights. Even in the rare cases when
                        they can afford to go to court, the service is poor. India, for example, has only 11 judges for
                        every 1million people.</p>

                    <p>These alarming statistics are contained in a report from a commission on the legal empowerment
                        of the poor, released on June 3rd at the United Nations. It argues that not only are such
                        statistics evidence of grave injustice, they also reflect one of the main reasons why so much of
                        humanity remains mired in poverty. Because they are outside the rule of law, the vast majority
                        of poor people are obliged to work (if they work at all) in the informal economy, which is less
                        productive than the formal, legal part of the economy.</p>

                    <p><b>Chariot</b></p>

                    <p>Rodrigo Quijada Plubins</p>

                    <p><b>Definition</b></p>

                    <p>The chariot was a light vehicle, usually on two wheels, drawn by one or more horses, often
                        carrying two standing persons, a driver and a fighter using bow-and-arrow or javelins. The
                        chariot was the supreme military weapon in Eurasia roughly from 1700 BCE to 500 BCE but was also
                        used for hunting purposes and in sporting contests such as the Olympic Games and in the Roman
                        Circus Maximus.</p>

                    <p>Horses were not used for transport, ploughing, warfare or any other practical human activity
                        until quite late in history, and the chariot was the first such application. Donkeys and other
                        animals were preferred in early civilizations.</p>

                    <p><b>The Horse</b></p>

                    <p>The horse’s main ecological niche was the Eurasian steppe; a very wide (4,800 km) and narrow
                        (800 km on average) strip of grassland running roughly from Hungary to China, encompassing parts
                        of what today is Ukrania, southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan,
                        Tajikistan and Mongolia. For most of ancient history, the steppe - which means “wasteland” in
                        Russian - was the home of nomadic societies whose economy was based on herding, complemented by
                        hunting and, to a much lesser degree, sporadic, itinerant agriculture. No cities or settled
                        communities existed in the steppe, save a very few spots.</p>

                    <p>Steppe dwellers domesticated the horse for the purpose of breeding it for food like sheep and
                        other animals already domesticated. That process is unfortunately poorly understood, and it
                        occurred sometime before 2500 BCE. The wheel, an invention imported from the Middle East, had
                        arrived in the steppe around 3100 BCE. The invention of the chariot in the steppe - perhaps
                        originally meant as an improved tool for hunting - occurred roughly by 2000 BCE, probably in the
                        area just east of the southern Ural mountains, where the oldest chariots have been unearthed.
                        The word for horse appears just around this date for the first time in Mesopotamia, when an
                        increase in north-south trade through Iran is attested.</p>

                    <p><b>Invention of the Chariot</b></p>

                    <p>The chariot then became a moving platform from which soldiers could shoot at enemies. Arrows and
                        javelins were the main weapons used by the fighter on board, while a second person drove the
                        chariot. The tactic was to move constantly, in and out of the battle, shooting from a distance.</p>

                    <p>There is no clear explanation as to why humans invented the chariot first, before riding the
                        horse directly, which seems more straightforward to us. A chariot was obviously more expensive
                        than the horse alone, and chariots could not enter or properly manoeuver in landscapes where a
                        mounted horse can, such as hills, marshes or forests. We know people tried mounting horses very
                        early, as we have found drawings depicting it, but those seem rare experiments that did not seem
                        to work. The most common scholarly suggestion is that horses at that time were weaker than in
                        the present, unsuitable for supporting a man and only after a very long period of constant,
                        selective breeding, did a stronger horse come into being. Horses started consistently to be
                        mounted roughly a millennium and a half after the chariot was invented.</p>

                    <p>The “compound bow”, invented sometime during the second millennium BCE, was the final ingredient
                        for the rise of a deadly ensemble. Bow and arrow were much older, and the innovation of the
                        compound bow was the use of two types of materials, inside and outside the bow, which gave it
                        considerably more power. Compound bows were able to accurately hit a target 300 m away, and
                        penetrate an armour 100 m away. It was the preferred weapon of charioteers and later horseback
                        riding societies. Its power is reflected in the fact that these bows were last used in war as
                        recently as the 19th century CE by the Chinese, well into the age of firearms.</p>

                    <p>We have scarce knowledge of what happened with the communities in the steppe once the chariot
                        was invented. We can assume that war intensified - and some evidence about it does exist -, and
                        those who first or better grasped the new invention stormed their neighbours, sizing valuable
                        hunting and pasturing land rights. We truly understand the impact of the chariot only when this
                        new form of warfare came out of the steppes and into the settled, agricultural lands.</p>

                    <p><b>Charioteers & Warfare</b></p>

                    <p>The first reference to charioteers comes from Syria around 1800 BCE. Over the course of the next
                        four centuries, chariots advanced into civilization, either by direct migration of steppe people
                        or by diffusion, and it quickly came to be the preferred elite weapon.</p>

                    <p>(...)</p>

                    <p>Everywhere, in Europe, the Middle East, India, and China, all rulers, from petty chiefs to great
                        pharaohs, took the chariot as their master weapon. They started depicting themselves riding
                        chariots, waging wars in chariots, including chariots and horses in their tombs as symbols of
                        power, and so on. Their surrounding aristocracy, of course, followed suit, so the elite forces
                        in every polity came to be charioteers. The horse came to be a valuable military asset, no
                        longer a food source. Horse breeding became key for these states, and all powerful kings aspired
                        to have the proper stables to supply their armies with chariots; imports from the steppes,
                        though, long remained their major source.</p>

                    <p>The most famous chariot battle was that of Kadesh (1294 BCE), fought between the two superpowers
                        of the time, Egypt and Hatti (Hittites), where some 50 chariots are presumed to have
                        participated for each side. The small number of chariots compared to infantry troops is a good
                        indicator of how effective the chariot was: in China, the ratio was up to 25 infantry soldiers
                        per chariot.</p>

                    <p><b>Decline in Use</b></p>

                    <p>The use of the chariot declined very slowly, starting around 500 BCE (and yet, in some parts of
                        Europe the technology was just arriving at that time). First and probably foremost, because
                        horseback riding was developed in the steppes, and slowly but surely replaced the need for
                        chariots. The first known forces mounting horses were those of the Scythians, steppe people who
                        in the 7th century BCE attacked the Assyrian empire on horseback. Second, because infantry,
                        formerly helpless against chariots, became more sophisticated due to the expanding use of iron
                        weapons (from c. 1200 BCE onwards), and to new tactics in the form of phalanx formations.
                        Fighting the invading Romans, the Celts were probably the last people who used chariots
                        extensively, until around the 4th century CE.</p>
